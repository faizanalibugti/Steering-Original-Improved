# Steering Angle Prediction using Deep Learning

This repository introduces changes to our original steering angle model in the hope that correct predicitons are obtaned with consistency and it can be deployed with minimal tuning to the screen capture parameters

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Navigate to the repo on your harddisk using Anaconda Prompt
3. Run ***python steer.py**

Screen Capture parameters in line 38 by default are:
monitor = {"top": 40, "left": 50, "width": 1000, "height": 600}
